# D.A.T.A (Data Authentication, Trust, and Attestation) Framework

[![License: ISC](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-ISC-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/ISC)

> An AI-native framework for autonomous blockchain data interaction and analysis, developed by CARV.

## 🌟 Overview

D.A.T.A is a cutting-edge framework that bridges the gap between AI agents and blockchain data. Built as a plugin for AI frameworks like Eliza, it enables AI agents to autonomously fetch, process, and act on both on-chain and off-chain data, fostering intelligent, data-driven decision-making in the Web3 space.

## 🚀 Features

- **On-Chain Data Access**
  - Real-time blockchain data fetching (transactions, balances, activity metrics)
  - Scalable backend integration with AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, and Amazon Athena
  - Support for multiple blockchain networks including Ethereum and Solana

- **Off-Chain Data Integration**
  - User profiles and behavioral analytics
  - Token metadata and market information
  - Contextual data enrichment

- **AI-Native Architecture**
  - Vector database integration for semantic search
  - Autonomous decision-making capabilities
  - Built-in memory management for AI agents

- **Cross-Chain Analytics**
  - Unified data aggregation across blockchains
  - Standardized query interface
  - Comprehensive blockchain activity analysis

- **Collaborative Intelligence**
  - Shared on-chain memory system
  - Centralized knowledge repository
  - Inter-agent communication protocols

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- Python 3.8+
- Access to blockchain node or data provider
- API credentials for data services

## 🔧 Configuration
